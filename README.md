 # Horiseon's Corperate Home Page

 ## What is this project?
 This project is the home page for the infamous Horiseon, a team of people designed to make sure your business website has the correct SEO qualifications, not only to be seen on Google, but to avoid a lawsuit.

## This project required a few tasks to complete:
* Changing any non-SEO HTML elements to SEO HTML elements
* Making sure the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Cleaning up any repetitive code in CSS
* Creating accessible alt attributes for all image elements
* Making sure all the heading attributes fall in sequential order
